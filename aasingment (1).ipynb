    "\n",
    "1. *Encapsulation:* It involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal details of the object and restricting access to the data, only allowing it to be modified by well-defined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Abstraction:* Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential features an object must have. It allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it achieves its functionality. Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Inheritance:* Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors of an existing class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes, where the subclass can extend or override the functionalities of the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Polymorphism:* Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables a single interface to represent different types of objects, and it can be achieved through method overloading and method overriding. Polymorphism contributes to code flexibility and extensibility."
